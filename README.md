# Profitability Prediction App

This machine learning project predicts whether an order is profitable or not based on factors like sales, discount,
and quantity. To run the app, clone the repository using `git clone https://github.com/Muphata/profitability-prediction-app.git`,
create and activate a virtual environment with `python -m venv venv` and `venv\Scripts\activate`,
install the dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`, and then run the app using `streamlit run app.py`. 
This app uses Streamlit for the interface, and you can interact with it to make predictions based on different input values.
